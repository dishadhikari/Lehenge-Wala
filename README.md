# Lehenge-Wala
Lehenge Wala lets users rent and share premium clothing. People can list their outfits, others can browse and request rentals and we handle pickup and delivery. This promotes sustainable circular fashion, reduces waste, saves money and turns unused wardrobe items into earning opportunities.
